is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Trunk uses a simple, optional-config pattern for building &amp; bundling WASM, JS snippets &amp; other assets (images, css, scss) via a source HTML file.\nGetting Started\nInstall\nFirst, install Trunk via one of the following options.\nPlain cargo\nDownload the sources and build them yourself:\n\nYou can also toggle some features using the --features flag:\n\nrustlsUse rustls for client and server sockets\nnative-tls (default)Enable the use of the system native TLS stack for client sockets, and `openssl` for server sockets\nupdate_check (default)Enable the update check on startup\n\nNOTE: If both rustls and native-tls are enabled, rustls will be used. You can disable the default rustls using\n--no-default-features.\nCargo binstall\nYou can download a released binary from GitHub releases through binstall.\n\nGitHub release download\nFetch and unpack a released binary from the release page.\nFor example (be sure to check for the most recent version):\n\nNixOS\n\nBrew\n\nAdditional tools\nAny additional tools like wasm-bindgen and wasm-opt are automatically downloaded and managed by trunk. Therefore, no further steps required 🎉.\nNote: Until wasm-bindgen has pre-built binaries for Apple M1, M1 users will need to install wasm-bindgen manually.\n\nApp Setup\nAny wasm-bindgen-based framework will work with Trunk. If you're new to frontend development in Rust, Yew and Leptos are two popular options.\nThe easiest way to ensure that your application launches properly is to setup your app as an executable with a standard main function:\n\nTrunk uses a source HTML file to drive all asset building and bundling. Trunk also uses the official dart-sass, so let's get started with the following example. Copy this HTML to the root of your project's repo as index.html:\n\nThe index.scss file may be empty but must exist.\ntrunk build will produce the following HTML at dist/index.html, along with the compiled scss, WASM &amp; the JS loader for the WASM:\n\nThe contents of your dist dir are now ready to be served on the web.\nNext Steps\nThat's not all! Trunk has even more useful features. Head on over to the following sections to learn more about how to use Trunk effectively.\n\nAssets: learn about all of Trunk's supported asset types.\nConfiguration: learn about Trunk's configuration system and how to use the Trunk proxy.\nCommands: learn about Trunk's CLI commands for use in your development workflows.\nAdvanced topics: learn about some more advanced topics.\nJoin us on Discord by following this link \n\nContributing\nAnyone and everyone is welcome to contribute!

It will also\ninclude all JavaScript snippets generated by wasm-bindgen for interfacing with JavaScript functionality.\nBy default, functions exported from Rust, using wasm-bingen, can be accessed in the JavaScript code through the global\nvariable window.wasmBindings. This behavior can be disabled, and the name can be customized. For more information\nsee the rust asset type.\nLibrary crate\nAside from having a main function, it is also possible to up your project as a cdylib project. In order to do that,\nadd the following to your Cargo.toml:\n\nAnd then, define the entrypoint in your lib.rs like (does not need to be async):\n\nInitializer\nSince: 0.19.0-alpha.1.\nTrunk supports tapping into the initialization process of the WASM application. By\ndefault, this is not active and works the same way as with previous versions.\nThe default process is that trunk injects a small JavaScript snippet, which imports the JavaScript loader generated\nby wasm_bindgen and calls the init method. That will fetch the WASM blob and run it.\nThe downside with is, that during this process, there's no feedback to the user. Neither when it takes a bit longer to\nload the WASM file, nor when something goes wrong.\nNow it is possible to tap into this process by setting data-initializer to a JavaScript module file. This module file\nis required to (default) export a function, which returns the \"initializer\" instance. Here is an example:\n\nFor a full example, see: https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/tree/main/examples/initializer.\nUpdate check\nSince: 0.19.0-alpha.2.\nTrunk has an update check built in. By default, it will check the trunk crate on crates.io for a newer\n(non pre-release) version. If one is found, the information will be shown in the command line.\nThis check can be disabled entirely, but not enabled the cargo feature update_check. It can also be disabled during\nruntime using the environment variable TRUNK_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK, or using the command line switch\n--skip-version-check.\nThe check is only performed every 24 hours.\nBase URLs, public URLs, paths &amp; reverse proxies\nSince: 0.19.0-alpha.3.\nOriginally trunk had a single --public-url, which allowed to set the base URL of the hosted application.\nPlain and simple. This was a prefix for all URLs generated and acted as a base for trunk serve.\nUnfortunately, life isn't that simple and naming is hard.\nToday trunk was three paths:\n\nThe \"public base URL\": acting as a prefix for all generated URLs\nThe \"serve base\": acting as a scope/prefix for all things served by trunk serve\nThe \"websocket base\": acting as a base path for the auto-reload websocket\n\nAll three can be configured, but there are reasonable defaults in place. By default, the serve base and websocket base\ndefault to the absolute path of the public base. The public base will have a slash appended if it doesn't have one. The\npublic base can be one of:\n\nUnset/nothing/default (meaning /)\nAn absolute URL (e.g. http://domain/path/app)\nAn absolute path (e.g. /path/app)\nA relative path (e.g. foo or ./)\n\nIf the public base is an absolute URL, then the path of that URL will be used as serve and websocket base. If the public\nbase is a relative path, then it will be turned into an absolute one. Both approaches might result in a dysfunctional\napplication, based on your environment. There will be a warning on the console. However, by providing an explicit\nvalue using serve-base or ws-base, this can be fixed.\nWhy is this necessary and when is it useful? It's mostly there to provide all the knobs/configurations for the case\nthat weren't considered. The magic of public-url worked for many, but not for all. To support such cases, it\nis now possible to tweak all the settings, at the cost of more complexity. Having reasonable defaults should keep it\nsimple for the simple cases.\nAn example use case is a reverse proxy in front of trunk serve, which can't be configured to serve the trunk\nwebsocket at the location trunk serve expects it. Now, it is possible to have --public-url to choose the base when\ngenerating links, so that it looks correct when being served by the proxy. But also use --serve-base / to keep\nserving resource from the root.\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/advanced/","title":"Advanced"},"https://trunkrs.dev/assets/":{"body":"Declaring assets to be processed by Trunk is simple and extensible.\nLink Asset Types\nAll link assets to be processed by Trunk must follow these three rules:\n\nMust be declared as a valid HTML link tag.\nMust have the attribute data-trunk.\nMust have the attribute rel=\"{type}\", where {type} is one of the asset types listed below.\n\nThis will typically look like: &lt;link data-trunk rel=\"{type}\" href=\"{path}\" ..other options here.. /&gt;.

Also see: Minification.\ndata-target-path: (optional) Path where the output is placed inside the dist dir. If not present, the directory is placed in the dist root. The path must be a relative path without ...\n\nJS Snippets\nJS snippets generated from the wasm-bindgen JS snippets feature are automatically copied to the dist dir, hashed and ready to rock. No additional setup is required. Just use the feature in your application, and Trunk will take care of the rest.\nImages &amp; Other Resources\nImages and other resource types can be copied into the dist dir by adding a link like this to your source HTML: &lt;link data-trunk rel=\"copy-file\" href=\"path/to/image\"/&gt;. Any normal file type is supported. This will cause Trunk to find the target resource, and copy it to the dist dir unmodified. No hashing will be applied. The link itself will be removed from the HTML. To copy an entire directory of assets/images, you can use the following HTML: &lt;link data-trunk rel=\"copy-dir\" href=\"path/to/images-dir\"/&gt;.\nThis will allow your WASM application to reference images directly from the dist dir, and Trunk will ensure that the images are available in the dist dir to be served.\nNOTE: as Trunk continues to mature, we will find better ways to include images and other resources. Hashing content for cache control is great, we just need to find a nice pattern to work with images referenced in Rust components. Please contribute to the discussion over in trunk#9! See you there.\nSub-resource integrity (SRI)\nTrunk can automatically generate hashes of files and add the integrity attribute for resources fetched by the web\napplication. This is enabled by default, but can be overridden using the data-integrity attribute. See the different\nasset types.\nThe following values are available:\n\nnone\nsha256\nsha384 (default)\nsha512\n\nDirectives\nYou can instruct Trunk to write the URL passed to --public-url to the HTML output by adding this to your &lt;head&gt;: &lt;base data-trunk-public-url/&gt;.\nTrunk will set the href attribute of the element to the public URL. This changes the behavior of relative URLs to be relative to the public URL instead of the current location.\nYou can also access this value at runtime using document.baseURI which is useful for apps that need to know the base URL on which they're hosted (e.g. for routing).\nHooks\nIf you find that you need Trunk to perform an additional build action that isn't supported directly, then Trunk's flexible hooks system can be used to launch external processes at various stages in the pipeline. Hooks can be declared exclusively in Trunk.toml, and consist of a stage, command and command_arguments:\n\nstage: (required) one of pre_build, build or post_build. It specifies when in Trunk's build pipeline the hook is executed.\ncommand: (required) the name or path to the desired executable.\ncommand_arguments: (optional, defaults to none) any arguments to be passed, in the given order, to the executable.\n\nAt the relevant point for each stage, all hooks for that stage are spawned simultaneously. After this, Trunk immediately waits for all the hooks to exit before proceeding, except in the case of the build stage, described further below.\nTrunk's build process\nThis is a brief overview of Trunk's build process for the purpose of describing when hooks are executed. Please note that the exact ordering may change in the future to add new features.\n\nStep 1 — Read and parse the HTML file.\nStep 2 — Produce a plan of all assets to be built.\nStep 3 — Build all assets in parallel.\nStep 4 — Finalize and write assets to staging directory.\nStep 5 — Write HTML to staging directory.\nStep 6 - Replace dist directory contents with staging directory contents.\n\nThe hook stages correspond to this as follows:\n\npre_build: takes place before step 1.\nbuild: takes place at the same time as step 3, executing in parallel with asset builds.\npost_build: takes place after step 5 and before step 6.\n\nHook Environment &amp; Execution\nAll hooks are executed using the same stdin and stdout as trunk. The executable is expected to return an error code of 0 to indicate success. Any other code will be treated as an error and terminate the build process. Additionally, the following environment variables are provided to the process:\n\nTRUNK_PROFILE: the build profile in use. Currently, either debug or release.\nTRUNK_HTML_FILE: the full path to the HTML file (typically index.html in TRUNK_SOURCE_DIR) used by trunk.\nTRUNK_SOURCE_DIR: the full path to the source directory in use by Trunk. This is always the directory in which TRUNK_HTML_FILE resides.\nTRUNK_STAGING_DIR: the full path of the Trunk staging directory.\nTRUNK_DIST_DIR: the full path of the Trunk dist directory.\nTRUNK_PUBLIC_URL: the configured public URL for Trunk.\n\nOS-specific overrides\nOften times you will want to perform the same build step on different OSes, requiring different commands. \nA typical example of this is using the sh command on Linux, but cmd on Windows. \nTo accomodate this, you can optionally create OS-specific overrides for each hook. \nTo do this, specify the default hook, then directly below it create a [hooks.&lt;os&gt;] entry where &lt;os&gt; \ncan be one of windows, macos, or linux. Within this entry you must specify only the command and \ncommand_argumnets keys. You may provide multiple overrides for each hook. i.e. \nOne for windows, one for macos, and one for linux.\nAuto-Reload\nAs of v0.14.0, Trunk now ships with the ability to automatically reload your web app as the Trunk build pipeline completes.\nMinification\nTrunk supports minifying of assets. This is disabled by default and can be controlled on various levels.\nIn any case, Trunk does not perform minification itself, but delegates the process to dependencies which do the actual\nimplementation. In cases where minification breaks things, it will, most likely, be an issue with that dependency.\nStarting with Trunk 0.20.0, minification is disabled by default. It can be turned on from the command line using the\n--minify (or -M) switch. Alternatively, it can be controlled using the build.minify field in the Trunk.toml\nfile. The value of this field is an enum, with the following possible values: never (default, never minify),\non_release (minify when running Trunk with --release), always (always minify).\nWhen minification is enabled, all assets known to trunk (this excludes the copy-dir and copy-file opaque blobs to\nTrunk), will get minified. It is possible to opt out of this process on a per-asset basis using the data-no-minify\nattribute (see individual asset configuration). In this case, the asset will never get minified.\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/assets/","title":"Assets"},"https://trunkrs.dev/commands/":{"body":"Trunk ships with a set of CLI commands to help you in your development workflows.\nbuild\ntrunk build runs a cargo build targeting the wasm32 instruction set, runs wasm-bindgen on the built WASM, and spawns asset build pipelines for any assets defined in the target index.html.\nTrunk leverages Rust's powerful concurrency primitives for maximum build speeds &amp; throughput.\nwatch\ntrunk watch does the same thing as trunk build, but also watches the filesystem for changes, triggering new builds as changes are detected.\nserve\ntrunk serve does the same thing as trunk watch, but also spawns a web server.\nclean\ntrunk clean cleans up any build artifacts generated from earlier builds.\nconfig show\ntrunk config show prints out Trunk's current config, before factoring in CLI arguments.

At the base, a config file can encapsulate project specific defaults, paths, ports and other config. Environment variables can be used to overwrite config file values. Lastly, CLI arguments / options take final precedence.\nTrunk.toml\nTrunk supports an optional Trunk.toml config file. An example config file is included in the Trunk repo, and shows all available config options along with their default values. By default, Trunk will look for a Trunk.toml config file in the current working directory. Trunk supports the global --config option to specify an alternative location for the file.\nNote that any relative paths declared in a Trunk.toml file will be treated as being relative to the Trunk.toml file itself.\nTrunk Version\nStarting with 0.19.0-alpha.2, it is possible to enforce having a certain\nversion of trunk building the project.\nAs new features get added to trunk, this might be helpful to ensure that the\nversion of trunk building the current is actually capable of doing so. This can\nbe done using the trunk-version (or using the alias trunk_version) on the\nroot level of the Trunk.toml file.\nThe version format is a \"version requirement\", the same format you might know\nfrom Cargo's version field on dependencies as a Semantic Versioning\nconstraint.\nThis also supports pre-release requirements, which allows to adopt upcoming\nfeatures early.\nNOTE: Versions prior do 0.19.0-alpha.2 currently do not support this\ncheck, and so they will silently ignore such an error for now.\n\nBuild section\nThe build section has configuration settings for the build process. These\ncontrol the arguments passed to Cargo when building the application, and the\ngeneration of the assets.\n\nWatch section\nTrunk has built-in support for watching for source file changes, which triggers\na rebuild and a refresh in the browser. In this section, you can override what\npaths to watch and set files to be ignored.\n\nServer section\nTrunk has a built-in server for serving the application when running trunk serve.\nThis section lets you override how this works.\n\nClean section\nThe clean section controls the behaviour when running trunk clean, which will\nremove build artifacts.\n\nProxy section\nThe Trunk.toml config file accepts multiple [[proxy]] sections, which\nallows for multiple proxies to be configured. Each section requires at least\nthe backend field, and optionally accepts the rewrite and ws fields, both\ncorresponding to the --proxy-* CLI flags discussed below.\nAs it is with other Trunk config, a proxy declared via CLI will take final\nprecedence and will cause any config file proxies to be ignored, even if there\nare multiple proxies declared in the config file.\n\nHooks section\nHooks are tasks that are run before, during or after the build. You can run\narbitrary commands here, and you can specify multiple hooks to run.\n\nEnvironment Variables\nTrunk environment variables mirror the Trunk.toml config schema. All Trunk environment variables have the following 3 part form TRUNK_&lt;SECTION&gt;_&lt;ITEM&gt;, where TRUNK_ is the required prefix, &lt;SECTION&gt; is one of the Trunk.toml sections, and &lt;ITEM&gt; is a specific configuration item from the corresponding section. E.G., TRUNK_SERVE_PORT=80 will cause trunk serve to listen on port 80. The equivalent CLI invocation would be trunk serve --port=80.\nIn addition, there is the variable TRUNK_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK which allows to control the update check (if that is)\ncompiled into the version of trunk.\nCLI Arguments &amp; Options\nThe final configuration layer is the CLI itself. Any arguments / options provided on the CLI will take final precedence over any other config layer.\nProxy\nTrunk ships with a built-in proxy which can be enabled when running trunk serve. There are two ways to configure the proxy, each discussed below. All Trunk proxies will transparently pass along the request body, headers, and query parameters to the proxy backend.\nProxy CLI Flags\nThe trunk serve command accepts two proxy related flags.\n--proxy-backend specifies the URL of the backend server to which requests should be proxied. The URI segment of the given URL will be used as the path on the Trunk server to handle proxy requests. E.G., trunk serve --proxy-backend=http://localhost:9000/api/ will proxy any requests received on the path /api/ to the server listening at http://localhost:9000/api/. Further path segments or query parameters will be seamlessly passed along.\n--proxy-rewrite specifies an alternative URI on which the Trunk server is to listen for proxy requests. Any requests received on the given URI will be rewritten to match the URI of the proxy backend, effectively stripping the rewrite prefix. E.G., trunk serve --proxy-backend=http://localhost:9000/ --proxy-rewrite=/api/ will proxy any requests received on /api/ over to http://localhost:9000/ with the /api/ prefix stripped from the request, while everything following the /api/ prefix will be left unchanged.\n--proxy-insecure allows the --proxy-backend url to use a self signed certificate for https (or any officially invalid certs, including expired). This would be used when proxying to https such as trunk serve --proxy-backend=https://localhost:3001/ --proxy-insecure where the ssl cert was self signed, such as with mkcert, and routed through an https reverse proxy for the backend, such as local-ssl-proxy or caddy.\n--proxy-no-sytem-proxy bypasses the system proxy when contacting the proxy backend.\n--proxy-ws specifies that the proxy is for a WebSocket endpoint.\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/configuration/","title":"Configuration"}},"docInfo":{"https://trunkrs.dev/":{"body":320,"title":1},"https://trunkrs.dev/advanced/":{"body":395,"title":1},"https://trunkrs.dev/assets/":{"body":1639,"title":1},"https://trunkrs.dev/commands/":{"body":111,"title":1},"https://trunkrs.dev/configuration/":{"body":536,"title":1}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
